Demo of a simple react app that directly connects to a postgresql database via express.
Does not use any object relational middleware (ORMs) such as sequelize for the DB access.
This is just a private version of a tutorial forked from: 

        https://github.com/Njong392/Postgresql-reactjs

The original code is well explained in this blogpost/tutorial:

cheers!
